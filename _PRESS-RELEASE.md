There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
N-Queens Javscript Recursive Solution Visualizer

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Explore and easily understand an extremely efficient solution to the N-Queens puzzle with vivid visuals that are simple for even beginner programmers to follow.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Learn an extremely efficient algorithm in Javascript involving bitwise operation and symmetry optimization. Easy-to-follow visuals make this complex algorithm simple to understand. Demystify one of the most infamous recursion problems in computer science!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
Recursion is often a confusing topic for many, especially for beginners in programming. N-Queens is particularly complex. The algorithm presented in this application is extremely fast; it can count the number of 10-Queens solutions in only Javascript in a laptop browser console in less than one millisecond! However, this adds further complicateion to other N-Queens algorithms by using bitwise operation and symmetry optimization.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
N-Queens Javascript Recursive Solution Visualizer will demystify a highly complex but efficient Javascript solution to the N-Queens puzzle. Visuals include a diagram that displays each recursive stack and the current value of their variables, as well as a chessboard that populates with queens as the algorithm runs! The algorithm pauses at the beginning and end of each recursive call, allowing the user to examine each variable in the process until he or she clicks to move to the next stack.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
I've always had a passion for recursive algorithms, and I'm so excited that now we have a tool to help everyone see how easy recursion can be, and I hope more people will fall in love with this important and awesome concept in programming. This is also a valuable tool to help review bitwise operation, which many programmers don't get much exposure to because it is seldom used in popular languages such as Javascript. I truly hope everyone will enjoy using this application!

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
Just simply click on the start button, and the algorithm will begin! Keep clicking 'Next' to watch the algorithm progress, and go at your own pace until you understand the algorithm. Look the stacks diagram to see the values of all variables in each recursive stack, and watch the chessboard as the algorithm adds queens to the board and backtracks at dead ends!


## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
As a beginning programmer, I still struggle quite a bit with understanding recursion. A few weeks ago, I saw an N-Queens counting algorithm that was less complicated than the one presented in this app, and after 15 minutes, I completely gave up on trying to understand it. I was so amazed when I tried out this app and was easily able to understand this even more complicated algorithm in only a few minutes! I can't wait for this tool to be built for other famous recursion problems in computer science. Now I'm really excited about recursion!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
We hope you enjoy this tool, and we look forward to adding other famous recursive algorithms to the series in the future!
